Dear {{ student }},
 
Thank you for signing up for ESP! We're looking forward to seeing you this

enrolled in the following ESP course(s):

Please attend a single course from each timeslot in which you have courses.
You may request adjustments in your class schedule throughout the first two
weeks, based on limited course availability.

When you arrive, please come to Science Center Hall A. This year we'll be using
classrooms in both Jefferson and the Science Center, but we'll all convene at
Science Center A for registration on the first day. I've attached a map of our
campus (our location is circled in red) as well as some information on directions
and parking.

Teachers and students have a scheduled lunch break from 12 to 1 pm. Lunch is not
provided; students may elect to bring a lunch or eat at a number of inexpensive
restaurants in Harvard Square, which is a five-minute walk from our program.

If we have been in touch with you about receiving travel assistance, please make
sure to talk to one of the ESP board members at any point during the day on
Saturday. We'll be wearing brown ESP t-shirts so you can find us!

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at harvardesp@gmail.com.
For any urgent inquiries on Saturday, you can reach us by phone at 857-600-2ESP
(857-600-2377).

Best,
Becky

Harvard ESP Co-Director
